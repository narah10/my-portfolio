# Overview

I'm a front-end web developer with a passion for learning and improving. I built this portfolio website to stay updated on the latest web technologies and best practices with TypeScript. My goal is to showcase my experience and skills as I continue to grow in the field of software engineering.


I developed this porfolio website with TypeScript, React and Tailwind. The website mostly focuses on introducing myself and showing the skills I have in web development. I was able to implement a github api so I can display my github repositories as well. Visitors can navigate through the projects from github and can also visit those repositories as well.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
